        The goal of the Computer Science club is to be a platform for CHC students to           <!--Club description ADD <br> LATER if needed-->
        enhance their programming and teamwork skills. As a group, we work on a variety
        of different projects with the intention of diversifying our experiences and our
        project portfolio. This includes topics ranging from game design to website
        creation, and even post graduate career readiness. The club is always changing
        to reflect the wants and needs of current members, so join now!
