    <h2>Who We Are:</h2>
    <p class="footerInfo">
        The goal of the Computer Science club is to be a platform for CHC students to           <!--Club description ADD <br> LATER if needed-->
        enhance their programming and teamwork skills. As a group, we work on a variety
        of different projects with the intention of diversifying our experiences and the
        project portfolio of each member. This includes topics ranging from game design
        to website creation, and even post graduate career readiness. The club is always
        changing to reflect the wants and needs of current members, so join now!
